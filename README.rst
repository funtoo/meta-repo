meta-repo
===========================
master branch
---------------------------

Meta-repo is a git repository that contains all the ports trees for Funtoo
Linux. The ports trees for Funtoo Linux are stored in the ``kits`` sub-directory,
as git *submodules*. For those who are unfamiliar with submodules, they are
essentially git's flavor of 'symbolic links' to other repositories, so that
a git repository can link to other repositories.

---------------
Using Meta-Repo
---------------

To use meta-repo as your meta-repository for Funtoo Linux, first make sure that
you have not defined ``PORTDIR`` in ``/etc/make.conf`` to point to a specific
Portage repository location. If you have ``PORTDIR`` defined, comment it out or
remove this line. Then, perform the following steps as root:

::

 # install -d /var/git
 # cd /var/git
 # git clone --recursive https://github.com/funtoo/meta-repo.git
 # rm /usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf
 # mv /etc/portage/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf.bak
 # mkdir /etc/portage/repos.conf
 # ln -s /var/git/meta-repo/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf/funtoo
 # chown -R portage:portage /var/git/meta-repo
 # my_pyver="$(eselect python show --python3)"
 # USE="python_targets_${my_pyver/./_} python_single_target_${my_pyver/./_}" emerge -1 --nodeps ego
 # hash -r
 # epro update

At this point, you should be able to use the ``emerge`` command and use 
Portage normally. Once you have kits running well, at that point you may re-enable
any custom overlays.

--------------------------------------------
Updating to Meta-Repo with Funtoo Containers
--------------------------------------------

If you are a Funtoo Container user, you can enable meta-repo in your container
as follows. First make sure that you remove the ``PORTDIR=/var/src/portage``
line from ``/etc/make.conf``. Then perform the following steps as root:

::

 # install -d /var/git/meta-repo
 # reboot

After your container restarts, you will have a read-only version of meta-repo
mounted inside your container. At this point, you can perform the following
steps to complete the migration to meta-repo:

::

 # rm /usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf
 # mv /etc/portage/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf.bak
 # ln -s /var/git/meta-repo/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf

------------------
Updating Meta-Repo
------------------

From now on you will be using 'ego sync' to update the Portage tree:

::

 # ego sync

After updating, the ``emerge -auDN @world`` command may be used to update your
system.

What is Included
----------------

Meta-repo consists of a number of 'kits', which are independent overlays that
contain ebuilds related to a specific set of functionality. The following kits
currently exist as submodules in meta-repo. Note that xorg-kit is the only one
that is currently documented:

`core-kit`_
  Core-kit contains a set of what we consider 'core' ebuilds -- ebuilds needed
  to build a stage3, plus essential userland utilities, firmware, development tools and
  libraries, except for perl and python.

`python-kit`_
  As the name suggests, python-kit contains all ebuilds related to python,
  which includes ``dev-lang/python`` as well as all all ``dev-python`` ebuilds.

`perl-kit`_
  Similar to ``python-kit``, perl-kit contains all ebuilds related to perl.

`php-kit`
  Similar to ``python-kit``, php-kit contains ebuilds that provide core PHP
  support.

`security-kit`_
  Security-kit contains all core ebuilds related to Kerberos, SELinux and other
  security-enhanced Linux technologies.

`editors-kit`_
  Editors-kit contains all ebuilds related to text editors, including vim,
  emacs and xemacs and their plugins.

`media-kit`_
  Media-kit contains all ebuilds related to media, which typically includes
  all ebuilds in the ``media-*`` category other than those that are included
  in ``xorg-kit``.

`xorg-kit`_
  Xorg-kit contains all ebuilds that provide core graphics functionality,
  including xorg-server, OpenGL/Mesa, Vulkan, etc.

`desktop-kit`
  Desktop-kit includes all non-GNOME, KDE or GNUSTEP desktop environments and
  applications. This includes all window managers, leechcraft, office suites,
  lxde, lxqt, MATE, XFCE and general X applications, terms and themes.

`gnome-kit`
  Gnome-kit includes all ebuilds related to setting up a GNOME environment.

`kde-kit`
  Kde-kit includes all ebuilds that compose a KDE environment, and associated
  KDE/QT applications.

`media-kit`
  Media-kit contains all media and graphics-related applications and tools.

`net-kit`
  Net-kit contains all network applications, including Web and other application
  servers, as well as Web browsers.

`science-kit`
  Science-kit contains all ebuilds related to scientific research.

`text-kit`
  Text-kit contains text-related tools and libraries, TeX, texlive, dictionaries
  and documentation.

`java-kit`
  Java-kit contains all Java-related ebuilds -- JDKs, JREs, java libraries, etc.

`dev-kit`
  Dev-kit contains all development tools, libraries and utilities, except for
  core dev tools and libraries, perl, python, PHP and Java.

`games-kit`
  Games-kit contains all games, except for certain games included by default
  with desktop environments (which will be bundled in gnome-kit, for exmaple.)

`nokit`_
  The 'nokit' kit contains all ebuilds that have not yet been 'kitted', or
  added to their own kit. If an ebuild isn't in one of the kits above, and it's
  in Funtoo, then it's part of nokit.

---------------
Active Branches
---------------

The following branches are active by default in meta-kit:

============   ============
kit            branch
------------   ------------
core-kit       1.0-prime
python-kit     3.4-prime
perl-kit       5.24-prime
security-kit   1.0-prime
media-kit      1.0-prime
xorg-kit       1.17-prime
gnome-kit      3.20-prime
php-kit        7.1.3-prime
java-kit       master
dev-kit        master
kde-kit        master
desktop-kit    master
editors-kit    master
net-kit        master
text-kit       master
science-kit    master
games-kit      master
nokit          master
============   ============

"-prime" indicates an enterprise-stable branch, "-snap" indicates a stable branch,
and "master" indicates a branch that exists simply to group ebuilds -- no freezing
of ebuilds occurs here and the latest ebuilds from Gentoo are made available.

These are the branches that we plan to maintain going forward.
